This project focuses on analyzing Ola ride data to uncover meaningful insights related to ride patterns, customer behavior, revenue trends, and operational performance.The dashboard is built using Power BI and provides interactive visuals for better business understanding.

**Objective**
The main goals of this project are to:
Analyze ride demand and usage trends
Identify peak hours and high-demand locations
Understand customer ride behavior
Measure ride cancellations and service efficiency
Support data-driven decision making

**Tools & Technologies Used**
Power BI – Dashboard creation and visualization
Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Creating calculated measures
Excel / CSV Dataset – Source data

**Data Cleaning & Preparation**
The dataset was prepared using Power Query:
Removed null and duplicate records
Fixed data types for dates, time, and numeric fields
Created calculated columns for analysis
Standardized values across categorical columns

**DAX Measures Used**

DAX was used to create key performance measures, including:

Cancellation Rate (%)
Measures the percentage of cancelled rides compared to total bookings.
This helps in understanding service reliability and customer behavior.
Additional measures for totals, averages, and performance tracking

**Dashboard Features**
The dashboard highlights:
Total bookings and completed rides
Cancellation rate and ride success ratio
Time-based ride trends (daily, weekly, monthly)
Location-wise ride distribution
Peak booking hours and demand patterns
Interactive filters for deeper analysis

**Key Insights**
Cancellation rate varies across time slots and locations
Certain hours show higher cancellation probability
High-demand areas contribute significantly to total rides
Clear difference in ride patterns between weekdays and weekends
